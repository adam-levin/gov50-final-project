## Project thoughts

I am interested in exploring data related to the changing pricing for the top crypto currencies and the general movements of the S&P 500/NASDAQ/Dow. The goal would be to get a better understanding of how correlated/inter-connected these markets are generally. Does the price (and price movements) of ETH and BTC match that of the S&P 500/NASDAQ/Dow? Does one influence the other? This relationship would be incredibly fascinating to explore and overtime I will hone in on a more specific relationship/question to target...maybe it's price and liquidity or just one versus the other. Nonetheless, I am super excited to explore this space! It could be interesting to also include the top NFT project price movements as well in exploring these markets complex and unique relationships!
